# Diary App
This is a dairy app which has login and signup functionality and we can even delete a user. Users are able to enter Date, Title, Content of the diary. 
Content being in multiple lines.The Date textfield is filled with the date of the day the user is entering the diary; So minimal typing is required. Users are able to
Edit the diary including its date. We have tried our best to make the app appealing and aesthetic. Thank you
